noo-ebs uses IPv6.  Many Internet Service Providers still do not provide IPv6.  Certain noo-ebs information requires IPv6 in order to access, being on IPv6 only servers.  As a result, obtaining an IPv6 internet connection will be helpful.  The following providers offer free IPv6 tunnerls:

gogo6:

sixxs:

Hurricane Electric also provides IPv6:

There is more and more information for IPv6 on the internet and HE.net provides a decent certifiation course for learning about IPv6 from simple to extensive:

Generally gogo6 is the simplest path to IPv6 without native or dual stack configurations, followed by sixxs (a more stringent process), and finally HE.net (which requires a significant amount to networking skills).
