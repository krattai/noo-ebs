JabberPi
=======

JabberPi is a Jabber chat bot and has been forked from its original git repository, located here:
https://github.com/SoftCognito/JabberPi

There are two reference folders, the one from git called git_JabberPi and a second one, labelled JabberPi.  The latter appears to be newer code, which was tested to work, and was pulled from a google code repository here:
https://code.google.com/p/jhub1/

This is in reference by the installation and configuration instructions of what appears to be the original developer of the code:
http://www.softcognito.org/Raspberry_Pi_Communication_Bot.html

JabberPi is a framework for allowing a noo-ebs devices to send and receive chat messages by way of distributed XMPP servers, and is the reason for this reference code.
