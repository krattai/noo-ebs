Changes from 1.8.0 to 1.9.0:
commit 19df4cbd1

	Upgrade to PolarSSL 1.3.0 

commit 21d4cc95b

    Change flags for building .so on macports (A new sample filter broke the
	old options)

commit e61fee3e7

	Add an option to stream large uploads to a handler using a token credit
	system to prevent over-buffering.

commit 3a58aa0da

	Add an option ssl.verify_required to mandate client certificate
	verification

commit 9024156ad

    Add a control XREQ type; only supported option is a keep-alive which acts
	as a "ping" for the mongrel2 idle connection killer

commit 854cff6e9

	Add mongrel2 header field "REMOTE_ADDR" with the actual remote from
	mongrel2.
	Add option "no_clobber_xff" which will preserve the x-forwarded-for field
	from the client/upstream proxy.

	Old behavior was to replace the x-forwarded-for header with the remote
	address to mongrel2.  This new way is better since it still allows a
	trusted field (REMOTE_ADDR) while also preserving x-forwarded-for for
	setups that include (for instance) a load-balancer or external
	ssl-terminator.

	We don't replace the old behavior for x-forwarded-for unless requested,
	since older handlers may trust that header.

commit b82451f343

    Add ability to have a separate control port for each server


commit ea6a9cd729

    This was hotfixed-into 1.8.1 and fixed some bugs in how the deliver task
	gets killed.

commit ef1c601777
    
    Add a few MIME type mappings

commit 89ed061396

	Adds TLS SNI identification

    In the certdir, place e.g. example.com.key and example.com.crt to have SNI
	work.  1.9.0 should fall back on the old key/crt files if these aren't
	found

commit 81bf4ac84ba

	Adds a new "Extended" handler reply format, and a plugin system to hook
	into them.  A sample plugin was created that will do x-sendfile like
	responses (The handler sends the proper headers, then an extended reply
	keyed to the plugin, which causes mongrel2 to dump a file to the
	connection)

commit 82b3ab000dc

    Docs fixes for ubuntu installation instructions

commit 24b2ed3936a

    A number of either completely or nearly non-functional changes to make
	a static analyzer happy.
